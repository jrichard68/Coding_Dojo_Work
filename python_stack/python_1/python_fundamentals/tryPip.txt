tried to install Django with pip but it wouldn't work.  Look back a page and saw a "$" in front of pip so tried it again and it worked
--got this back
usage: install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]
               [-o owner] file1 file2
       install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]
               [-o owner] file1 ... fileN directory
       install -d [-v] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] directory ...

--looks like it telling me what it's doing while it's doing it

$pip list command does not work for mac; it's $pip ls.  Got back my directory but don't see Django

I don't know waht the about usage: means.  Am I suppose to run all these install commands?

"freeze" command is not found nor is $ pip freeez command

Ok.  got pip install after reading https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/install-django-on-mac-or-linux/

then I went back and tried commands from learning platform; Django installed 7/extras/lib/python wiht a number of exceptions in red.

pip list gave me a Deprcation: warning adn then list of packages installed with their version #'s

When asking to install Django again, got "requirement already satisfied adn installing collected packages: Django and exceptions: same ones as last time

pip freeze--got same list of packages with the exceptions and depreciation warnings

"ls" I see a txt file

when pipe freeze > requirements.txt it created txt doc with same info as pip freeze

when "pip uninstall Django" got message in read "Cannot uninstall requirement Django, not installed". I don't know what's "not installed" 

Django must never have been installed!

"pip show Django" commnad yields nothing

"pip search Flask" got back a long list of flask related programs with versions
